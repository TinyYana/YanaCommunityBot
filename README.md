# YanaCommunityBot
A Discord Bot based on JDA (Java Discord API) for my own ACG Discord community.

## How to run this Bot?
You just need to simply run it through a .bat file.
```bat
java -jar YanaCommunityBot.jar
pause
```

## The bot is buggy!
This is normal, because the Bot is under development and there is a lot of content that has not yet been completed.
If you are interested in developing a Java Discord Bot or have knowledge about it, feel free to contribute to this project or fork it!
