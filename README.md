# YanaCommunityBot
A Discord Bot based on JDA (Java Discord API) for my own ACG Discord community.

## How to run this Bot?
You just need to simply run it through a .bat file.
```bat
java -jar YanaCommunityBot.jar
pause
```
But you probably won't be able to use this bot with a simple edit of config.yml, as there is currently some hard coding in the code that needs to be improved for testing purposes or if you don't know how to implement it. So the best way is to modify the code and compile it yourself.

## Current Features
- Dynamic Voice Channel
- Guild Join Message
- Guild Leave Message

## The bot is buggy!
This is normal, because the Bot is under development and there is a lot of content that has not yet been completed.
If you are interested in developing a Java Discord Bot or have knowledge about it, feel free to contribute to this project or fork it!
